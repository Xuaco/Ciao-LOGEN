TO DO file for LOGEN
--------------------

* In rev_nonterm: Ciao seems to fail after a certain accumulator length, rather
than loop. Check that Ciao at least throws an exception.

* In watchdog mode: homemorphic does not compute static and dynamic functors;
hence all functors are assumed static which could endanger termination



Differences between Ciao and SICStus:
-------------------------------------

- cannot re-export imported predicate in module in Ciao

- quoting:

SICSTUS:
! Syntax error in read_term/3
! incorrect_escape_char

post_unfold_body('\+'(A),'\+'(PA)) :- !, post_unfold_body(A,PA).

- add_message(cogen_run,3,"Generating Unfolder ~n for ~w.~n",[CNR,Call]),
does not generate inconsistency error in Ciao
