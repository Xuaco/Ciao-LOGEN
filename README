LOGEN is an offline partial evaluation system for Prolog written using the so called "cogen approach".
Basically, the cogen is a system which: based upon an annotated version of the program to be specialised produces a specialised partial evaluator for that program.
This partial evaluator is called a generating extension the generating extension can be used to specialise the program in a very efficient manner.

Once downloaded you can test the installation with:
 make cogen
 make test

This should finish without errors.

To compile:
 make cogen

To specialise:
 ./cogen PlFile "goal(A,B)"

For help:
 ./cogen --help

Output gx files should be standalone ciao executables.  So after
specialising match.pl, match.pl.gx.cpx should be the executable.
 ./match.pl.gx.cpx --help
 ./match.pl.gx.cpx "match([a,a,b],R)"
