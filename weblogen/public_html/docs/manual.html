<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>WebLogen is a web interface to the <span class="logen">logen</span> partial
evaluation system. This allows you specialise your Prolog programs without ever
installing <span class="logen">logen</span> itself; it requires only a
reasonably up-to-date browser such as Mozilla Firefox, Safari or Internet
Explorer. If you experience any problems, please check the 
<a href="#incompat">Browser Compatibility</a> section. Javascript is required
to use certain features, although basic use is probably still possible without
it.
</p>
<p>Partial evaluation is a process, which given only partial input for a
program, transforms it into a new program which is hopefully smaller, faster or
both. Prolog is a logic-based declarative language built upon the idea that
users should specify what problem they want to solve rather than how to do it
as in imperative languages.</p>

<h2><a name="source">Entering Source Programs</a></h2>

<p>There are three main ways to provide source code to WebLogen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter text directly</li>
<li>Choose a file from your local computer</li>
<li>Select an example file provided by WebLogen</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="open.png" alt="Providing a source program to WebLogen"/></p>

<p>You can enter text directly by typing into the large text box on the
&ldquo;Open File&rdquo; page. When you have finished, then press the Next
button. Weblogen will attempt to parse your program and if this fails, you will
be shown the error message along with the probable location of the error.</p>

<p>If you already have a program you wish to specialise, type the local name of
the file into the Local File box or click Browse to use the file opener built
into your browser. This button may be labelled differently in some browsers. 
Clicking Upload will take you straight to the annotation page, while clicking
Upload and Edit allows you to modify the file first.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you want to test WebLogen but have no programs of your own,
you can select one of our pre-prepared examples by selecting one from the
Example menu and clicking Open. You can also edit the examples first by
clicking Open and Edit.</p>

<h2><a name="annotation">Annotating Programs</a></h2>

<p>Programs can be initially annotated in four different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You can provide your own annotations. These will generally be in a file
with a <tt>.pl.ann</tt> extension and can either be written manually or can
obtained at later stages in the WebLogen process. Once you have selected a file,
click Upload File.
</p>
<p>
<img src="upload.png" alt="Upload your own annotations"/>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you have no annotations of your own, the simplest way to start is to
use the simple BTA. This gives you the option of either annotating 
unfold or call on each predicate or using memo or rescall.</p>

<p>The first option is
the most aggressive and in many cases will cause
<span class="logen">logen</span> not to terminate. It can however be useful
starting point which can be refined in the next stage. The other option is the
most conservative and if you specialise a program directly with this option,
you will end up with a program identical to your initial one. Again the result can be refined later. When you have chosen the annotation mode, click Apply BTA.
</p>
<img src="simplebta.png" alt="Use the simple BTA to create initial annotations"/>
</li>

<li>
<p>The automatic BTA is a way of annotating programs both aggressively so that
you can achieve real performance increases, but which is also safe and will
ensure that the specialisation terminates.</p>
<p>In most cases you just enter a filter such as 
<tt>match(static, dynamic)</tt>, which states that the entry point to the
program is <tt>match</tt> and that its first argument is static while its second
is dynamic. For <tt>match</tt>, this means that the <i>pattern</i> is fixed, but
that the search string will be supplied when the final program is run. Once
you have supplied the appropriate data, click Apply BTA.</p>

<p>You can also specify that the BTA should only propagate filters and not
change annotations (they will then all default to unfold/call).</p>

<p>If the BTA does not give you annotations you want, you could try using a
different norm. A different norm can sometimes show a program is safe to
annotate with more aggressive annotations.</p>

<p>
<img src="autobta.png" alt="Use the automatic BTA to create a set of annotations that are safe and yet fairly aggressive"/>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For the example programs there will be an option to use a ready-made
annotation file (if provided). Having chosen one, click Use Ready-Made
Annotations.
<p>
<img src="readymade.png" alt="For example programs, you can use ready-made annotations"/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="spec">Specialisation</a></h2>

<p>In the third stage, you should be able to see your annotated program. This
will be made up of a highlighted version of your source program and a list of
filters. Each annotation is indicated by a different colour and text decoration.
You can find out what each one means my moving the mouse over it, which causes
a description to appear below the program.
</p>

<p>To specialise the program you must specify a goal. This looks like a call
to a predicate, where you specify fixed data now for static arguments and free
variables for dynamic arguments (including return values). For instance,
<tt>match([a,b], X)</tt> specifies that the pattern argument for <tt>match</tt>
should be a list <tt>[a,b]</tt> and that the list to be searched is unknown.
If you chose to use an example program provided by WebLogen, there may be a
Stock goals menu which gives some appropriate goals. Their appropriateness is
of course dependent on the annotations chosen.
</p>
<p>
<img src="spec.png" alt="After annotation, you can now specialise your program"/>
</p>
<p>In addition, you can choose to specialise in watchdog mode, which can detect
when the specialisation is looping infinitely and halt it. This determination
relies on heuristics since the problem is undecidable, but it can be useful
nonethelss. Changing the logging information makes
<span class="logen">logen</span> output more verbosely to the log it generates
as it specialises. In general extra logging information will only be useful
to the <span class="logen">logen</span> developers.
</p>
<p>
When you are ready, click Specialise. Shortly, a residual program should appear
on your screen. At the bottom of the page is a link to download the program
so you can save it.
</p>

<p>Clicking Show Log will show the logging output of
<span class="logen">logen</span>. This can be useful if something unexpected
happens. The log can be hidden by pressing the button again. If specialisation
failed (e.g. because you annotated a non-whitelisted predicate as call or
because the process timed out), the log will be displayed instead of the
program. To try a different goal, or refine the program annotations just press
your browser's back button.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2><a name="refining">Refining Annotations</a></h2>

<p>Once you have chosen your initial annotations, you can refine them to try
and get a different result. To do this move the mouse over the predicate which
you wish to change. Click with the left mouse button and a menu should appear
with a list of annotations (the current one will be highlighted). Click on the
desired annotation and the colour should change. You can do this as many times
as you like, but when you are finished you must click Upload new annotations in
order that your changes be saved.
</p>
<p>
<img src="changeann.png" alt="Changing the annotation for match1 from unfold to memo"/>
</p>

<p>The simplest way to edit the filters is to click on the parameter types
(e.g. static or dynamic). Just select the type you want or move the mouse away
if you want to leave it unchanged.</p>

<p>
<img src="changefilt.png" alt="Changing the filter for match"/>
</p>

<p>To <em>memo</em> a predicate, you must ensure that a filter exists for it.
Clicking on the name of a predicate (coloured blue) in the source pane will
automatically add a filter with that name and arity to the filter pane. This
filter will have all the parameter types set to dynamic and will likely need
adjustment. If you forget to create the filter first when you select memo, you
will be asked whether you want to create one. You can delete a filter by
clicking on the filter keyword in the definition for it.</p>

<p>A more powerful way to edit filters is to enter the filter text manually.
This allows the use of complex filter types such <tt>type list(dynamic)</tt>.
To enter this mode click the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; above the filters pane. Once you
have edited the filters, click &ldquo;Save Changes&rdquo;.
<p>
<img src="editfilters.png" alt="The filters can also be edited"/>
</p>
<h2><a name="incompat">Browser Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>We intend to support all browsers listed below. Since we have limited
resources we have only tested on the following browsers and so it is possible
and even likely that other browsers will work as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox >=1.0</li>
<li>Internet Explorer >=6</li>
<li>Safari >=1.3</li>
<li>Opera >=8.0</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specific Issues</h3>
<p>Some versions of Safari 2.0 have a bug which causes the menus to disappear
the moment the mouse is moved. This bug is difficult to solve in Weblogen, but
hopefully will be fixed in the next update to Safari. See the
<a href="http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5764">bug report</a>
for details.</p>

<p>To use all of the features of Weblogen, you need Javascript. If Javascript is
not available you will not be able to modify the annotations using the web
interface, but will have to edit the annotation file manually before uploading
it. In addition you may find it difficult to change the annotation method in
stage 2.</p>
