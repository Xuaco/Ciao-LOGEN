Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements:
1. Ciao Prolog (logen needs it).
2. SWI Prolog (required for syntax highlighting. Ciao cannot give position
information while parsing). Version 5.4.7 is known to work. Version 5.2.13 (the
one supplied in Debian GNU/Linux) compiles the backend, but will produce
spurious errors rendering Weblogen useless.
3. Sicstus Prolog (optional: allows use of BTA).
4. PHP 5. PHP 4 is not supported any more. XSL Support is a must. We have a
test page that ensures that your PHP is compatible.
5. A webserver. Any server that supports PHP 5 should be fine.
6. Make. Required by build process.

Step 1:
Change to the logen directory and run the install.sh script. This will compile
logen as well as installing Weblogen.

cd weblogen
sh install.sh

If you do not want to run the automatic installer, or you it doesn't work go to
the section titled "Manual Installation" later in this file.

Step 2:
Install PHP as explained below


MAC PHP Installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the PHP installer
 (http://www2.entropy.ch/download/Entropy-PHP-5.0.4-1.dmg) from:
	http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/
This contains php5 with expat and xslt support :-)
Run the Installer.

Edit /etc/httpd/users/<USERNAME>.conf  (e.g. <USERNAME> = leuschel)
to enable FollowSymLinks (you don't have to do this and the installer can cope
if symlinks aren't followed, but it can make things easier):
 
For example, the file /etc/httpd/users/leuschel.conf should now look like this:
<Directory "/Users/leuschel/Sites/">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

You may need to restart the Apache Webserver
(In System Preferences/Sharing/Services Turn Personal Web Sharing off and on
again).

PHP Installation Instructions for other platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Debian:
(as root) apt-get install php5-xsl

This will install PHP5 with XSL support.
(I know what you're thinking. Debian is really easy. Macs are a total pain.
Go figure.)


PHP5 Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that DOM and XSL are available. This is important for instance on Suse
which has a separate package for DOM, php5-dom, which must be installed.

Possible Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If errors are reported every time you specialise even though there is nothing
wrong the specialisation goal/annotations, it may be because you have
compiled PHP with --enable-sigchild. This causes all processes to return -1 on
exit which leads weblogen to think the process failed. To solve this, recompile
PHP with --disable-sigchild.



Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This assumes you are installing weblogen in a user's home directory.

(0. Change to the logen directory and run make. This requires that Ciao and
make are installed and will create the logen executable.)

1. Copy or symbolically link "public_html" of weblogen into the home directory.
	e.g.
	cp -r logen/weblogen/public_html ~/public_html/weblogen
	ln -s logen/weblogen/public_html ~/public_html/weblogen

2. In this directory create a file called config.php. This file is a PHP file
and so must be syntactically correct PHP. It also should produce no output so
the first line must start with '<?' and the last line must end with '?>'. You
can copy the config.php.example file in this directory to use as a template.

(a) add a line $backend_dir = '<path to backend>';
This is the location of the logen/weblogen/backend directory from the logen
tarball.

(b) add a line $logen_dir = '<path to logen>';
This is the location of the logen directory from the logen tarball.

(c) add a line $ciao_dir = '<path to ciao>';
This is the location of the ciao binary directory, e.g. /home/user/CiaoDE/bin

You need to insure that all these paths are accessible to your webserver, since
they contain executables that Weblogen requires.

There are many more configuration options, but these ones are all compulsory
and cannot be skipped. The others all have defaults; please see
config.php.example in this directory. (The installer creates this file for you.)

3. Enter the backend directory and create a Makefile.inc file.
	cd logen/weblogen/backend; vi Makefile.inc

Add:
SWIPL=pl or SWIPL=swipl depending on the name of your SWI Prolog executable.

Add:
ENABLE_BTA=true or ENABLE_BTA=false depending on whether you want the automatic
BTA to be compiled. (Note doing this won't enable it in the intercace unless you
add a line $enable_bta = true; to config.php file.)

Again, this file is created automatically by the install.sh script. The BTA is
automatically enabled if a sicstus executable can be found.

4. Run make.
	make

5. Connect to the web page http://localhost/~username/weblogen/setup.html to
test your PHP installation. You may have to recompile/reconfigure if your PHP
is incompatible.

6. Go to http://localhost/~username/weblogen/ to use weblogen.
